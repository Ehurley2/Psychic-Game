# Psychic-Game

The computer is thinking of a specific letter and you must guess which letter that is. To play, hit any letter key on your keyboard. If you've guessed correctly, a win will be added to the board. If you guess incorrectly, you have 8 more guesses. When your guesses run out, the computer will think of a new letter.

Good luck!
